>**<p align="justify"> Abstract:** *This repository presents the research undertaken in the Final Project for DSC190 - Intro- duction to Data Mining course. The purpose of this project is dual. In the first part of the associated notebook, Spotify Songs Dataset will be explored with the aim of developing and fine-tuning two Regression Models (XGBRegressor and Random-Forest Regressor) to predict the popularity of a song and evaluating their performance against a baseline model (LinearRegression). In a second section, in light of a deeper understanding of the dataset and its characteristics, we delve into the construction of a Content-Based Recommendation System which relies on "vectorization" and Cosine Similarity. In this second part of the project, the user can interact with the system to receive song recommendations starting from one of its Spotify playlists.*
